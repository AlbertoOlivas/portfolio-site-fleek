      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Self-Taught Blockchain Developer. I am a student at heart and
        love learning new technologies and new ways of creating and doing
        things. Having 9 years of business experience, I have build, run, and
        managed multiple businesses. Also, have done management consulting and
        business strategy consulting. Regular and clear communication is a top
        priority in all of my projects. I am experienced in Solidity, HTML, CSS
        and JavaScript. Get in touch, and let's create something great together.
